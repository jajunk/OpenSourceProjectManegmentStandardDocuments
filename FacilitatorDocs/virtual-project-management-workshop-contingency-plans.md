# Virtual Project Management Workshop Series: Contingency Plans

This document outlines strategies for addressing potential issues that may occur during our virtual workshops. Being prepared for these scenarios will help ensure a smooth experience for both the facilitator and participants.

## 1. Technical Issues

### Internet Connection Failure (Facilitator)
- Primary Plan: Switch to mobile hotspot.
- Backup Plan: Reschedule the session and immediately notify participants via email and chat.

### Internet Connection Issues (Participants)
- Provide dial-in numbers for audio-only participation.
- Record the session and share it afterwards.
- Offer a brief recap at the start of the next session.

### Video Conferencing Platform Failure
- Have a backup platform ready (e.g., if primary is Zoom, have Google Meet as backup).
- Communicate the switch via email and all available channels.

### Audio Issues
- Prepare written instructions for troubleshooting common audio problems.
- Have key points of your presentation in chat or slides for those who can't hear.

### Screen Sharing Problems
- Have a PDF version of slides ready to quickly share in chat.
- Prepare participants to access Gitea independently if demonstration sharing fails.

## 2. Attendance Issues

### Low Attendance
- Have a minimum attendance threshold for running the workshop.
- Prepare condensed version of the workshop that can be delivered in less time.
- Consider merging sessions if attendance is consistently low.

### Unexpected High Attendance
- Have a plan to manage larger groups (e.g., more use of chat for questions, less individual attention).
- Prepare additional breakout room activities that work for larger groups.

## 3. Content Delivery Issues

### Running Over Time
- Identify parts of the presentation that can be truncated if necessary.
- Prepare "take-home" materials for content you might not cover.

### Running Under Time
- Have additional examples or exercises prepared.
- Be ready to dive deeper into topics based on participant interest.

### Gitea Platform Unavailable
- Have screenshots prepared of key Gitea functionalities.
- Prepare a offline demo or a video recording of Gitea usage.

## 4. Participant Engagement Issues

### Low Engagement
- Prepare additional interactive elements (polls, quizzes) to spark engagement.
- Have discussion prompts ready to encourage participation.

### Disruptive Participant
- Review and be ready to use host controls for muting or removing participants if necessary.
- Prepare a private message template to address disruptive behavior one-on-one.

## 5. Facilitator Issues

### Facilitator Illness
- Have a backup facilitator on standby, briefed on the workshop content.
- Prepare a communication template to notify participants of date changes.

### Facilitator Environment Disruption (e.g., unexpected noise)
- Have a professional virtual background ready.
- Prepare an apology/explanation message template for chat.

## 6. Post-Workshop Issues

### Feedback Form Failure
- Have a backup Google Form or SurveyMonkey questionnaire prepared.
- Be ready to collect feedback via email if necessary.

### Resource List Unavailable
- Have a PDF version of the resource list ready to email to participants.

Remember, the key to managing unexpected issues is clear and prompt communication with participants. Always have their contact information easily accessible, and be transparent about any problems and the steps you're taking to address them.

Regularly review and update these contingency plans based on your experiences and any new potential issues you identify.
