# Ideas for further events and workshops

1. Case Study: Consider including a brief case study of a successful open-source project managed with Gitea. This could provide real-world context and inspiration for participants.

2. Interactive Elements: Add more hands-on activities throughout the workshop. For example, you could have participants set up a mock project in Gitea during the session.

3. Breakout Sessions: For longer workshops, consider adding breakout sessions where small groups can discuss specific challenges or work on mini-projects.

4. Resource List: Compile a list of additional resources (articles, books, tools) that participants can explore after the workshop to deepen their knowledge.

5. Follow-up Plan: Outline a plan for post-workshop engagement, such as a follow-up email series or a community forum where participants can continue to share experiences and ask questions.

6. Gitea-specific Features: If you haven't already, consider dedicating some time to explore Gitea-specific features that differentiate it from other platforms like GitHub or GitLab.

7. Metrics and KPIs: Include a section on how to measure project success using metrics and KPIs in Gitea.

8. Guest Speaker: If possible, invite a guest speaker (perhaps virtually) who has extensive experience in managing open-source projects with Gitea.

9. Troubleshooting Session: Add a brief troubleshooting session where you address common issues that arise in project management and how to solve them using Gitea.

10. Feedback Mechanism: Set up a way for participants to provide feedback on the workshop, which can help you improve future sessions.

11. Certificate of Completion: Consider offering a certificate of completion for participants, which can be a nice takeaway and motivation for attendance.

12. Pre-workshop Survey: Send out a pre-workshop survey to gauge participants' experience levels and specific areas of interest, allowing you to tailor the content more precisely.

These suggestions aim to make your workshop more engaging, practical, and valuable for the participants. Feel free to incorporate any that you feel would benefit your specific audience and workshop goals.
