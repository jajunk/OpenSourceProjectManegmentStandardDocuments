## 1. Introduction

This guide provides comprehensive instructions for deploying Accretion Linux in various environments, from personal computers to enterprise networks and cloud platforms.

## 2. System Requirements

- CPU: 64-bit x86 processor (x86_64)
- RAM: Minimum 2GB, 4GB recommended
- Storage: At least 20GB free space (40GB recommended)
- Graphics: Any modern graphics card with 3D acceleration
- Network: Ethernet or Wi-Fi adapter

## 3. Pre-installation Checklist

- [ ] Back up existing data
- [ ] Verify hardware compatibility
- [ ] Download latest Accretion Linux ISO
- [ ] Prepare installation media (USB drive or DVD)
- [ ] Disable Secure Boot (if applicable)
- [ ] Free up required disk space

## 4. Installation Methods

### 4.1 Standard Installation

1. Boot from installation media
2. Select "Install Accretion Linux"
3. Choose language and keyboard layout
4. Select installation disk and partitioning scheme
5. Create user account
6. Begin installation
7. Reboot when prompted

### 4.2 Network Installation

1. Set up PXE server with Accretion Linux image
2. Configure client machines to boot from network
3. Follow on-screen instructions (similar to standard installation)

### 4.3 Automated Installation

1. Create a preseed file with desired configuration
2. Boot from installation media with kernel parameters pointing to preseed file
3. Installation will proceed automatically

## 5. Post-installation Configuration

- Update system: `sudo apm update && sudo apm upgrade`
- Install additional software: Use AccretionPM or Software Center
- Configure firewall: `sudo accretion-firewall-config`
- Set up user accounts: `sudo accretion-user-manager`
- Configure system services: Edit files in `/etc/accretion/services/`

## 6. Updating and Upgrading

### System Updates
```
sudo apm update
sudo apm upgrade
```

### Major Version Upgrade
```
sudo accretion-release-upgrade
```

## 7. Backup and Recovery

### Creating System Backup
```
sudo accretion-backup --full --destination /path/to/backup
```

### Restoring from Backup
1. Boot into Accretion Linux live environment
2. Mount backup and target partitions
3. Run: `sudo accretion-restore /path/to/backup /dev/target_partition`

## 8. Troubleshooting

- Boot issues: Try booting with `nomodeset` option
- Package conflicts: Run `sudo apm check` and `sudo apm fix-broken`
- Log files: Check `/var/log/accretion/` for system logs

## 9. Enterprise Deployment

### 9.1 Directory Services
- Configure LDAP authentication: Edit `/etc/accretion/ldap.conf`
- Set up Kerberos: Use `accretion-kerberos-config` tool

### 9.2 Centralized Management
- Deploy Ansible for configuration management
- Use Puppet for large-scale deployments

### 9.3 Monitoring
- Set up Nagios or Zabbix for system monitoring
- Configure log aggregation with ELK stack

## 10. Cloud Deployment

### 10.1 Amazon Web Services (AWS)
1. Use official Accretion Linux AMI from AWS Marketplace
2. Launch EC2 instance with desired specifications
3. Connect via SSH and perform post-installation configuration

### 10.2 Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
1. Upload Accretion Linux image to Google Cloud Storage
2. Create a new VM instance using the custom image
3. Follow post-installation steps

### 10.3 Microsoft Azure
1. Use Azure CLI to upload Accretion Linux VHD
2. Create a new VM from the uploaded image
3. Connect and configure as needed

Remember to consult the official Accretion Linux documentation for the most up-to-date information and detailed instructions for specific deployment scenarios.
