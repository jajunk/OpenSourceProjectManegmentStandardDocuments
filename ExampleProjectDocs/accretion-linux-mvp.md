# Accretion Linux: Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Specification

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for Acreetion Linux, a custom Linux distribution aimed at providing a lightweight and versatile operating system. The MVP represents the core features and functionality that must be implemented for the ***initial release.***

## 2. MVP Goals

1. Create a bootable Linux distribution
2. Provide basic system functionality
3. Include essential software for daily use
4. Ensure stability and performance on target hardware
5. Implement a simple update mechanism

## 3. Core Features

### 3.1 System Base
- Linux Kernel (latest LTS version)
- Systemd init system
- Basic system utilities (coreutils, util-linux, etc.)

### 3.2 User Interface
- Lightweight desktop environment (XFCE)
- Display manager (LightDM)
- Basic theme and icon set

### 3.3 Package Management
- Custom package manager (AccretionPM) with basic functionality:
  - Install packages
  - Remove packages
  - Update system
  - Resolve dependencies

### 3.4 Pre-installed Software
- Web browser (Firefox)
- Text editor (AccretionEdit - basic version)
- Terminal emulator
- File manager
- System monitor
- Software center (GUI for AccretionPM)

### 3.5 Hardware Support
- Generic drivers for common hardware components
- Automated hardware detection
- Basic power management

### 3.6 Networking
- Network Manager for Wi-Fi and Ethernet connections
- Basic firewall configuration

### 3.7 System Installation
- Live system environment
- Graphical installer with basic options:
  - Disk partitioning
  - User account creation
  - Language/locale selection

### 3.8 Update System
- Basic system update mechanism through AccretionPM

## 4. Non-Features (Postponed for Future Releases)

- Advanced security features (SELinux, AppArmor)
- Full disk encryption
- Advanced power management
- Compatibility layers for non-native applications
- Cloud integration
- Advanced development tools

## 5. Performance Targets

- Boot time: Under 30 seconds on target hardware
- RAM usage at idle: Less than 500MB
- Disk space for base system: Under 5GB

## 6. Target Hardware

- CPU: 64-bit x86 processors (x86_64)
- RAM: Minimum 2GB
- Storage: Minimum 20GB
- Graphics: Basic GPU with 2D acceleration

## 7. Success Criteria

The MVP will be considered successful if:

1. The system successfully installs on target hardware
2. All core features function as described
3. The system remains stable under normal use conditions
4. Performance targets are met
5. Basic daily computing tasks can be accomplished

## 8. Future Considerations

While out of scope for the MVP, the following areas will be prioritized for future development:

1. Expanded software repository
2. Advanced system configuration tools
3. Improved hardware support
4. Enhanced security features
5. Developer-focused tools and environments

This MVP specification provides a clear, focused target for our initial release of Accretion Linux. It ensures we deliver a functional, albeit basic, operating system that can serve as a foundation for future enhancements.
