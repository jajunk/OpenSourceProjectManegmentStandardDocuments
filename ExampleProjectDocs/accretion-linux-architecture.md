# Accretion Linux: Architecture Overview

## 1. Introduction

This document provides a high-level overview of the architecture of Accretion Linux, outlining its major components and their interactions.

## 2. System Architecture

Accretion Linux follows a modular architecture, built on top of the Linux kernel. The system is composed of the following major components:

```
[User Applications]
         |
[Desktop Environment]
         |
[System Services] --- [Package Manager]
         |
[Init System]
         |
[Linux Kernel]
         |
[Hardware]
```

### 2.1 Linux Kernel

At the core of Accretion Linux is the Linux kernel, responsible for hardware abstraction, process management, and system calls.

### 2.2 Init System

Accretion Linux uses systemd as its init system and service manager, handling the boot process and managing system services.

### 2.3 System Services

These include essential daemons and background processes such as:
- NetworkManager for network configuration
- PulseAudio for audio management
- Xorg/Wayland for display server

### 2.4 Package Manager

A custom package manager built on top of pacman, providing:
- Software installation, removal, and updates
- Dependency resolution
- Repository management

### 2.5 Desktop Environment

A lightweight desktop environment (e.g., XFCE or LXQt) providing:
- Window management
- Panel for system tray, application launcher, etc.
- Settings management

### 2.6 User Applications

A curated selection of applications for productivity, development, and system management.

## 3. Key Subsystems

### 3.1 Boot Process

1. GRUB bootloader
2. Linux kernel initialization
3. systemd initialization
4. System services start-up
5. Display manager launch
6. User session start

### 3.2 File System Hierarchy

Follows the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) with some custom directories:
- /etc/accretion for system-wide configuration
- /usr/lib/accretion for Accretion-specific libraries
- /opt/accretion for optional Accretion-specific software

### 3.3 User Management

Utilizes systemd-logind for user session management and PAM for authentication.

### 3.4 Networking

NetworkManager handles network connections, with a custom GUI front-end for easy user configuration.

## 4. Security Architecture

- SELinux for mandatory access control
- AppArmor profiles for application sandboxing
- Regular security updates through the package manager
- Firewall management through ufw (Uncomplicated Firewall)

## 5. Customization and Extension

- A plugin system for the desktop environment allows easy customization
- A well-defined API for system utilities to interact with core components
- Hook scripts in the package manager for custom actions during package operations

## 6. Build and Release Process

- Automated build system using Jenkins
- ISO creation using custom scripts based on archiso
- Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for testing and releasing

This architecture is designed to be modular and flexible, allowing for easy customization and extension as the project evolves.
