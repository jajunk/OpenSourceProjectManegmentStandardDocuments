## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the testing strategy and plan for Accretion Linux. It provides a comprehensive approach to ensure the quality and reliability of our operating system.

## 2. Testing Objectives

- Ensure system stability and performance across supported hardware configurations
- Verify functionality of all core system components and pre-installed applications
- Validate the installation process and system upgrades
- Ensure compatibility with a wide range of hardware devices
- Verify security features and identify potential vulnerabilities

## 3. Test Environment

- Hardware: Various x86_64 machines (desktops, laptops, servers)
- Virtual Machines: QEMU/KVM, VirtualBox
- Network: Both wired and wireless configurations

## 4. Types of Testing

### 4.1 Unit Testing
- Focus: Individual components and functions
- Tools: GTest, PyTest

### 4.2 Integration Testing
- Focus: Interaction between system components
- Tools: Custom test scripts

### 4.3 System Testing
- Focus: Complete system functionality
- Approach: Both manual and automated testing

### 4.4 Performance Testing
- Focus: System responsiveness, boot time, application launch times
- Tools: Phoronix Test Suite

### 4.5 Security Testing
- Focus: Vulnerability scanning, penetration testing
- Tools: OpenVAS, Metasploit

### 4.6 Usability Testing
- Focus: User interface, user experience
- Approach: User studies, feedback collection

### 4.7 Compatibility Testing
- Focus: Hardware compatibility, software compatibility
- Approach: Testing on various hardware configurations, running common Linux software

## 5. Test Cases

Detailed test cases will be maintained in our TestRail instance. Key areas include:

- Installation process
- Boot process
- Core system utilities
- Networking functionality
- Package management (AccretionPM)
- Desktop environment
- Pre-installed applications
- Hardware detection and configuration
- System updates and upgrades

## 6. Automation Strategy

- Unit tests and integration tests will be fully automated and run on every commit
- System tests will be partially automated, with critical paths covered by automated tests
- Performance tests will be automated and run nightly
- Security scans will be automated and run weekly

## 7. Bug Tracking and Reporting

- All bugs will be tracked in our Gitea issue tracker
- Bug reports should include:
  - Steps to reproduce
  - Expected vs. actual results
  - System configuration
  - Log files (if applicable)
- Bugs will be prioritized based on severity and impact

## 8. Release Criteria

For a release to be approved:

- All critical and high-priority bugs must be resolved
- 95% of all test cases must pass
- Performance benchmarks must meet or exceed the previous release
- No known security vulnerabilities
- Successful completion of a two-week beta testing phase

## 9. Responsibilities

- QA Team: Execute test plans, report bugs, verify fixes
- Developers: Create and maintain unit tests, fix reported bugs
- Release Manager: Coordinate testing efforts, make go/no-go decisions
- Community Testers: Participate in beta testing, report issues

## 10. Schedule

- Daily: Run automated unit and integration tests
- Weekly: Run full system test suite, perform security scans
- Bi-weekly: Usability testing sessions
- Monthly: Full hardware compatibility testing
- Pre-release: Two-week beta testing phase

This test plan is subject to change as the project evolves. Regular reviews and updates will be conducted to ensure its effectiveness.
